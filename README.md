# ANT-X: AI Augmented Networking Tool for Transportation Analysis, Modeling, and Simulation 
The previous name is AI_Driven_Augmented_Lagrangian_Relaxation

An AI-Driven Adaptive Learning Framework for Large-Scale Dynamic Vehicle Scheduling with an Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation Method

# Overview

ANT-X-AI is a Python-based framework designed to construct and analyze Time-Space-State High-Dimensional Networks. It supports gradual network construction from lower-dimensional spaces to higher-dimensional spaces, ensuring that node and edge rules are seamlessly inherited across dimensions. This flexibility makes it ideal for advanced applications such as optimization, simulation, and artificial intelligence.

Key features include:
* Hierarchical Network Construction: Build high-dimensional networks incrementally from lower-dimensional spaces, enabling modular and scalable designs.
* Flexible Rule Definition: Define and inherit rules for nodes and edges, allowing logical consistency and simplified network construction.
* Multi-Package Integration: Future-ready for integration with various libraries and frameworks for analytical analysis, optimization, simulation, and AI.
* Visualization and Interaction: Includes tools for both static and interactive visualizations of high-dimensional networks.
